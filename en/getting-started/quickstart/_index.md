These instructions guide you through initializing Aspose.Cells Cloud API and installing the required spreadsheet-processing libraries.

You can easily integrate spreadsheet conversion, generation and editing features into applications running on any modern OS. They assist to read, edit, merge, split spreadsheets as well as convert spreadsheets to various file formats. These programming libraries allow you to work with a complete set of Spreadsheet components, such as data, styles, formulas, tables, chart, pivot table, headers, footers, comments, drawing objects, hyperlinks, watermarks, and much more.

## Get Your Security Credentials (Client Id & Secret)

Aspose attaches great importance to security issues. We use the JWT token for the  authentication and end-to-end HTTPS encryption to secure all client-server interactions.

An Application is a set of unique API credentials â€” **Client Id** and **Client Secret**. You can use them to authenticate when calling our Cloud API. In most cases, you require just a single Application. In some advanced scenarios, you may want to register and use several Applications with separate **Client Id & Secret** credentials.

To access information about your Applications, please perform the following steps:

1. Log in to [Aspose Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/)
2. On the left side of the page click the [Applications](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/applications) tab.

3. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, where you will find the default **"Fist App"** Application. Click the **"First App"** item to view and update your security credentials.
