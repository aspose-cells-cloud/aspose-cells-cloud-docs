&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditional formatting in Excel enables you to highlight cells with a certain color, depending on the cell's value.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use conditional formatting to help you visually explore and analyze data, detect critical issues, and identify patterns and trends.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditional formatting makes it easy to highlight interesting cells or ranges of cells, emphasize unusual values, and visualize data by using data bars, color scales, and icon sets that correspond to specific variations in the data.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A conditional format changes the appearance of cells on the basis of conditions that you specify. If the conditions are true, the cell range is formatted; if the conditions are false, the cell range is not formatted. There are many built-in conditions, and you can also create your own (including by using a formula that evaluates to True or False).
