The [OpenAPI Specification](https://apireference.aspose.cloud/cells/#/File/MoveFile) defines a publicly accessible programming interface and lets you carry out REST interactions directly from a web browser.
 
You can use cURL command-line tool to access Aspose.Cells web services easily. The following example shows how to make calls to Cloud API with cURL.
 
{{< tabs tabTotal="2" tabID="1" tabName1="Request" tabName2="Response" >}}
 
{{< tab tabNum="1" >}}
 
```bash
 
curl -v "http://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/storage/file/move/Book2.xlsx?destPath=MoveBook2.xlsx" \
-X PUT \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt token>"
 
```
 
{{< /tab >}}
 
{{< tab tabNum="2" >}}
 
```bash
{

"Status": "OK"
}
 
```
 
{{< /tab >}}
