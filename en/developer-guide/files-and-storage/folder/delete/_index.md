This REST API indicates `delete folder`.
 
## RSET API
 
```bash
 
DELETE http://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/storage/folder/{path}
 
```

The [OpenAPI Specification](https://apireference.aspose.cloud/cells/#/Folder/DeleteFolder) defines a publicly accessible programming interface and lets you carry out REST interactions directly from a web browser.
 
You can use cURL command-line tool to access Aspose.Cells web services easily. The following example shows how to make calls to Cloud API with cURL.
 
{{< tabs tabTotal="2" tabID="11" tabName11="Request" tabName12="Response" >}}
 
{{< tab tabNum="11" >}}
 
```bash
 
curl -v "http://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/storage/folder/desfolder" \

```
 
{{< /tab >}}
 
{{< tab tabNum="12" >}}
 
```bash

"Status": "OK"
}
 
```
 
{{< /tab >}}
