&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When creating an Excel workbook, users can use Excel comments for various reasons. One of the feature’s uses is to explain a formula in a cell, especially when other people will use the Excel file. Also, Excel comments can also be used to add reminders or notes for other users, as well as for cross-referencing with other Excel workbooks.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a comment’s been added, Excel provides users with the flexibility of resizing, changing the shape, as well as formatting the comments to their preferred style. An Excel user should master the ways of managing the comments in order to make maximum use of them.
