If you have originally created an Excel file in a certain format, like [XLS](https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/xls/), [XLSX](https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/xlsx/), [XLSB](https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/xlsb/), and [CSV](https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/csv/), you may sometimes find it useful to convert the excel file to another format so you can take advantage of special features provided by it. For example, you may want to convert an excel file to [PDF](https://docs.fileformat.com/pdf/) to protect your contents from any unauthorized modifications and make it easy to read and share simultaneously.

Document conversion is a complex process. Many factors contribute to the complexity and therefore, should be taken into account during the transformation process. The ability to convert Excel files from one format to another with a precise professional quality is a top feature of Aspose.Cells Cloud.

It works perfectly for any document format conversions. You can both import and export documents: [XLS](https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/xls/), [XLSX](https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/xlsx/), [XLSB](https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/xlsb/), [CSV](https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/csv/), [TSV](https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/tsv/), [XLSM](https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/xlsm/), [ODS](https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/ods/), [TXT](https://docs.fileformat.com/word-processing/txt/). The export-only formats: [PDF](https://docs.fileformat.com/pdf/), [OTS](https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/ots/), [XPS](https://docs.fileformat.com/page-description-language/xps/), [DIF](https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/dif/), [PNG](https://docs.fileformat.com/Image/png/), [JPEG](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpeg/), [BMP](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/bmp/), [SVG](https://docs.fileformat.com/page-description-language/svg/), [TIFF](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/tiff/), [EMF](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/emf/), [NUMBERS](https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/numbers/), [FODS](https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/fods/).
