**Types of document properties**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before starting to learn how to use Aspose.Cells Cloud Apis to view, change and remove document properties (metadata) in Excel, let's clear up what kinds of properties an Excel document can have.

- Standard properties are common to Excel. They contain basic information about the document such as title, subject, author, category, etc. You can assign your own text values for these properties to make it easier to find the Excel document.

- Custom properties are user-defined properties. They allow you to add other properties to your Excel document.
