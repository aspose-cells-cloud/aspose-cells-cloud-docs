## **sparklineGroup**

           is organized into sparkline group. A SparklineGroup contains a variable number of sparkline items.             A sparkline group specifies the type, display settings and axis settings for the sparklines.            

| Property Name | Property Type | Nullable |  ReadOnly | DefaultValue | Description | 
| :- | :- | :- |:- |  :- | :- |
| DisplayHidden | Boolean | True |  False |  | Indicates whether to show data in hidden rows and columns.  |  
| FirstPointColor | Class:CellsColor | True |  False |  | Gets and sets the color of the first point of data in the sparkline group.  |  
| HighPointColor | Class:CellsColor | True |  False |  | Gets and sets the color of the highest points of data in the sparkline group.  |  
| HorizontalAxisColor | Class:CellsColor | True |  False |  | Gets and sets the color of the horizontal axis in the sparkline group.  |  
| HorizontalAxisDateRange | String | True |  False |  | Represents the range that contains the date values for the sparkline data.  |  
| LastPointColor | Class:CellsColor | True |  False |  | Gets and sets the color of the last point of data in the sparkline group.  |  
| LineWeight | Floating | True |  False |  | Gets and sets the line weight in each line sparkline in the sparkline group, in the unit of points.  |  
| LowPointColor | Class:CellsColor | True |  False |  | Gets and sets the color of the lowest points of data in the sparkline group.  |  
| MarkersColor | Class:CellsColor | True |  False |  | Gets and sets the color of points in each line sparkline in the sparkline group.  |  
| NegativePointsColor | Class:CellsColor | True |  False |  | Gets and sets the color of the negative values on the sparkline group.  |  
| PlotEmptyCellsType | String | True |  False |  | Indicates how to plot empty cells.  |  
| PlotRightToLeft | Boolean | True |  False |  | Indicates whether the plot data is right to left.  |  
| PresetStyle | String | True |  False |  | Gets and sets the preset style type of the sparkline group.  |  
| SeriesColor | Class:CellsColor | True |  False |  | Gets and sets the color of the sparklines in the sparkline group.  |  
| ShowFirstPoint | Boolean | True |  False |  | Indicates whether to highlight the first point of data in the sparkline group.  |  
| ShowHighPoint | Boolean | True |  False |  | Indicates whether to highlight the highest points of data in the sparkline group.  |  
| ShowHorizontalAxis | Boolean | True |  False |  | Indicates whether to show the sparkline horizontal axis.            The horizontal axis appears if the sparkline has data that crosses the zero axis.  |  
| ShowLastPoint | Boolean | True |  False |  | Indicates whether to highlight the last point of data in the sparkline group.  |  
| ShowLowPoint | Boolean | True |  False |  | Indicates whether to highlight the lowest points of data in the sparkline group.  |  
| ShowMarkers | Boolean | True |  False |  | Indicates whether to highlight each point in each line sparkline in the sparkline group.  |  
| ShowNegativePoints | Boolean | True |  False |  | Indicates whether to highlight the negative values on the sparkline group with a different color or marker.  |  
| SparklineCollection | Container | True |  False |  | Gets the collection of  object.  |  
| Type | String | True |  False |  | Indicates the sparkline type of the sparkline group.  |  
| VerticalAxisMaxValue | Floating | True |  False |  | Gets and sets the custom maximum value for the vertical axis.  |  
| VerticalAxisMaxValueType | String | True |  False |  | Represents the vertical axis maximum value type.  |  
| VerticalAxisMinValue | Floating | True |  False |  | Gets and sets the custom minimum value for the vertical axis.  |  
| VerticalAxisMinValueType | String | True |  False |  | Represents the vertical axis minimum value type.  |
